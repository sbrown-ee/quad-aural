quad-aural
==========

Breakout/development board for a microphone array.

Requirements:
1. To create a low cost development board for multi-microphone applications.
2. An extensible (stackable) layout so that larger arrays can be formed.
3. Minimum pin usage, all I2S connections share the same clock and word clock.
4. 24kHz sampling rate.

Desireables:
1. 48kHz sampling rate.
2. Stackable for non-planar microphone orientation.
3. Stand-offs for stacking or mounting.


- Parts:
1. INMP441 - Invensense I2S microphone
